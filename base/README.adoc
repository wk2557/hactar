= `base` module
:doctype: article

This module includes the `instance` class and its corresponding smart pointer `const_ptr` class, with various *wrapers*.

The *Hactar* world consists of immutable objects and state transfers. We use 
*const_ptr* to model an immutable state of a mutable object that could be 
transfered into other state with side effects. This way, benefits brought 
by immutability could be maximized. We call a functor that wraps state 
transfer a *wraper*. To make it easier to understand, you can imagine a 
*const_ptr* is a generalized status code, and a *wraper* is a generalized 
bitwise operation.

These classes are the base components of *Hactar*, all other stuff is built on
them.

A quick example could be found in the link:base_test.cc[module test].

For class-specific documents, you could see comments in header files.
