== What *Hactar* is

*Hactar* is a C++ toolset for building applications (not the http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Hactar[ultimate weapon] :) ) in an explicit way. 

The key idea of *Hactar* is offering actions that combine actions to make bigger actions using templates.

The following is a quick example of *Hactar* used for simulating a calculator:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
unit<calc> (3.14) &
(wrap(multiply, 2.0) | wrap(add, 2.0)) & (wrap(add, 10.0) * 4) &
(wrap(add, 2.5) & wrap(multiply, 1.1) & wrap(add, 2.2)) &
mplus(wrap(multiply, 2.4)) & mclean();
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the above example code:

* `calc` is a class for simualting a calculator, which consists of immediate value and value in memory. 
* `add` and `multiply` are pure functions that change the immediate value of a calculator. 
* `unit` is an overloaded function to convert an immediate value into a new calculator instance. 
* `wrap` functions wrap raw functions into pure actions.
* `mplus` and `mclean` are actions supposed to have side-effects, and side-effects are defined in the overloaded `operator&` functions. 
* Actions could be combined into one for lazy evaluation by `operator&`. 
* Branching and looping are implemented by `operator|` and `operator*`.

For more details, you can find them in the link:base/base_test.cc[base module test]. 

For class-specific documents, you could see comments in every header file.

== How to be involved

*Hactar* is licensed under MIT lincense, you can find more information in the link:LICENSE[License] file. *Hactar* take the advantage of autotools, the shell commands `autoreconf --force --install; ./configure; make; make install` should pre-configure, configure, build, and install this package.

*Hactar* is still at a very early development stage. For now, we focus on developing base components.

After you clone the code, below commands can give helps:

* `autogen.sh` to generate make files using http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/[autotools].
* `make && make test` to build and test the software.
* `make html` to generate HTML documents using http://asciidoc.org[asciidoc].
* `make beautify` to beautify code using  http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net[uncrustify].
* `make cscope` to generate http://cscope.sourceforge.net[cscope] index.
* `make cleanup` to remove all generated files.
* `trycommit.sh` to check and try to commit code.
